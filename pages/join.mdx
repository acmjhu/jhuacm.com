# Join us

Anyone can become a member at no cost. Even non-CS majors. Even non-engineering types. OK, you still have to be a student or alum (or faculty member?) at Hopkins. Preferably, you should be interested in computers and information technology as well.

To join, you have to do three things:

1. Attend one of our weekly meetings.
2. Attend one of our weekly meetings.
3. Attend one of our weekly meetings.

That's three (3) meetings and you're in (you may substitute some other official event for a meeting). There are no membership dues, though we do take donations. Of course, it would be nice if you kept on attending meetings. Or stopped by the office once in a while.

## Email

Before you join, you might want to:

Join our Announce email list to stay informed of meetings and other happenings.

## Benefits

There are lots!

You can participate in exciting projects to bring new and interesting services to the JHU community, and voice your concerns about issues like information access, security, and privacy.

You'll receive an account on our computer systems that grants you access to a huge, ever-increasing range of services. You'll be able to:

- Use the workstations and printers in our office in Malone Hall.
- Have 50 GiB of storage space on our systems that you can access from anywhere in the world.
- Host a website using that storage space.
- Run virtual machines on our cluster.
- Get email at acm.jhu.edu / jhuacm.org.
- Access our computing resources for any project, locally or over the internet via SSH.
- Use our gitlab instance to host projects.
- Members also get J-Card access to the office, so you can come in at any time, 24/7. The office is a great place to just relax or even (gasp!) work. And we have soda, coffee, snacks, and a microwave.
